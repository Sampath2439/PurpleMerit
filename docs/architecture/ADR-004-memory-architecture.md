# Architecture Decision Record: Memory Architecture

## Title
ADR-004: Multi-Tier Adaptive Memory Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The multi-agent marketing system requires a sophisticated memory architecture to enable learning from interactions, pattern recognition, and knowledge accumulation while maintaining performance and scalability.

## Decision
Implement a four-tier memory architecture:

1. Short-Term Memory:
   - Active conversation contexts
   - Recent interactions
   - Temporary data caching

2. Long-Term Memory:
   - Historical interaction data
   - Lead preferences and profiles
   - Campaign performance history

3. Episodic Memory:
   - Success/failure patterns
   - Interaction sequences
   - Problem resolution paths

4. Semantic Memory:
   - Domain knowledge graph
   - Relationship networks
   - Concept hierarchies

## Implementation Details

### Memory System Architecture

```python
class MemorySystem:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str):
        self.short_term = ShortTermMemory(agent_id)
        self.long_term = LongTermMemory(agent_id)
        self.episodic = EpisodicMemory(agent_id)
        self.semantic = SemanticMemory(agent_id)

    async def consolidate_memories(self):
        """Memory consolidation process"""
        recent = await self.short_term.get_recent()
        patterns = self._extract_patterns(recent)
        await self.episodic.store_patterns(patterns)
        await self.semantic.update_knowledge(recent)
```

### Memory Consolidation
1. Importance Scoring:
   - Emotional impact
   - Business value
   - Novelty factor
   - Pattern frequency

2. Pattern Recognition:
   - Sequence matching
   - Clustering
   - Anomaly detection

3. Knowledge Integration:
   - Graph updates
   - Relationship inference
   - Concept learning

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. Memory Tiering:
   - Hot data in short-term memory
   - Warm data in long-term storage
   - Cold data in archived storage

2. Access Patterns:
   - Cached frequent access
   - Indexed search
   - Graph traversal optimization

3. Resource Management:
   - Memory limits per tier
   - Cleanup policies
   - Compression strategies

## Security Measures

1. Data Protection:
   - Encryption at rest
   - Access control
   - Audit trails

2. Privacy:
   - Data anonymization
   - Retention policies
   - Access logging

## Scalability Approach

1. Horizontal Scaling:
   - Distributed storage
   - Sharding strategies
   - Replication policies

2. Vertical Optimization:
   - Memory efficiency
   - Processing optimization
   - Resource management

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Health Metrics:
   - Memory usage
   - Access patterns
   - Consolidation performance

2. Maintenance Tasks:
   - Memory cleanup
   - Index optimization
   - Graph maintenance

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved learning capabilities
- Efficient information retrieval
- Pattern recognition
- Knowledge accumulation

### Negative
- System complexity
- Resource requirements
- Maintenance overhead
