# Agent Interaction Analysis and Conversation Flow

## Overview
This document details the interaction patterns and conversation flows between agents in the Marketing Multi-Agent System. It includes sequence diagrams, state transitions, and handoff protocols.

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### 1. Lead Processing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant LT as Lead Triage Agent
    participant EA as Engagement Agent
    participant CO as Campaign Optimizer
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant Memory as Memory System

    LT->>MCP: Get lead data
    MCP-->>LT: Lead information
    LT->>Memory: Check historical patterns
    Memory-->>LT: Similar cases
    LT->>LT: Score and categorize lead
    LT->>EA: Handoff qualified lead
    EA->>Memory: Get lead preferences
    Memory-->>EA: Personalization data
    EA->>CO: Request campaign selection
    CO->>MCP: Get campaign metrics
    MCP-->>CO: Performance data
    CO->>EA: Optimal campaign
    EA->>MCP: Record engagement
```

### 2. Campaign Optimization Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CO as Campaign Optimizer
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant Memory as Memory System
    participant EA as Engagement Agent

    CO->>MCP: Get campaign metrics
    MCP-->>CO: Performance data
    CO->>Memory: Get success patterns
    Memory-->>CO: Historical patterns
    CO->>CO: Generate optimizations
    CO->>EA: Update engagement strategy
    EA->>Memory: Store new pattern
```

### 3. Agent Handoff Protocol
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SA as Source Agent
    participant TA as Target Agent
    participant Memory as Memory System
    participant MCP as MCP Server

    SA->>Memory: Store conversation context
    SA->>MCP: Initiate handoff
    MCP->>TA: Notify handoff
    TA->>Memory: Load conversation context
    TA->>SA: Acknowledge handoff
    SA->>MCP: Complete handoff
```

## State Transitions

### Lead States
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> New
    New --> Qualifying
    Qualifying --> CampaignQualified
    Qualifying --> ColdLead
    Qualifying --> GeneralInquiry
    CampaignQualified --> Engaged
    Engaged --> Converted
    Engaged --> Lost
    ColdLead --> Nurturing
    Nurturing --> Qualifying
```

### Campaign States
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Active
    Active --> Optimizing
    Optimizing --> Active
    Optimizing --> Paused
    Active --> Completed
    Paused --> Active
    Paused --> Completed
```

## Memory Integration

### Memory Access Patterns
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Agent Request] --> B{Memory Type}
    B -->|Short Term| C[Recent Context]
    B -->|Long Term| D[Historical Data]
    B -->|Episodic| E[Success Patterns]
    B -->|Semantic| F[Knowledge Graph]
    C --> G[Response]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

## Conversation Context

### Context Preservation
```json
{
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "lead_id": "lead_456",
    "current_state": {
        "stage": "qualification",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "last_action": "score_calculation"
    },
    "history": [
        {
            "agent": "lead_triage",
            "action": "initial_scoring",
            "timestamp": "2025-09-01T10:00:00Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Handoff Protocol
1. Context Preservation
   - Store conversation state
   - Include lead history
   - Maintain preferences

2. State Management
   - Atomic transitions
   - Rollback capability
   - Audit logging

3. Error Handling
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Fallback options
   - Error notification

### 2. Memory Usage
1. Access Patterns
   - Cache hot data
   - Batch operations
   - Async updates

2. Optimization
   - Index key fields
   - Compress old data
   - Regular cleanup

3. Security
   - Access control
   - Data encryption
   - Audit trails

## Example Scenarios

### 1. Lead Qualification
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant LeadTriage
    participant Memory
    participant Engagement

    System->>LeadTriage: New lead
    LeadTriage->>Memory: Check history
    Memory-->>LeadTriage: Past interactions
    LeadTriage->>LeadTriage: Score lead
    LeadTriage->>Engagement: Qualified lead
    Engagement->>Memory: Store context
```

### 2. Campaign Optimization
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CO as CampaignOptimizer
    participant Memory
    participant EA as EngagementAgent

    CO->>Memory: Get performance
    Memory-->>CO: Historical data
    CO->>CO: Generate insights
    CO->>EA: Update strategy
    EA->>Memory: Store changes
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Response Times
- Agent processing: <500ms
- Memory access: <100ms
- Handoff completion: <1s

### 2. Throughput
- Lead processing: 100/minute
- Campaign updates: 10/minute
- Memory operations: 1000/minute

### 3. Resource Usage
- Memory footprint: <2GB/agent
- CPU utilization: <50%
- Network bandwidth: <100Mbps

## Monitoring

### 1. Key Metrics
- Handoff success rate
- Processing times
- Error rates

### 2. Alerts
- Failed handoffs
- High latency
- Error spikes

### 3. Logging
- Agent operations
- State transitions
- Memory access
