# Architecture Decision Record: MCP Protocol

## Title
ADR-002: Model Context Protocol Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The multi-agent marketing system requires a secure and efficient protocol for accessing marketing databases, analytics, and shared resources while maintaining data consistency and access control.

## Decision
Implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with the following key features:

1. Protocol Structure:
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 based communication
   - Resource-oriented access patterns
   - Built-in authentication and authorization

2. Resource Types:
   - Database (db://)
   - Analytics (analytics://)
   - Knowledge Graph (kg://)
   - Cache (cache://)

3. Operations:
   - read: Read-only access
   - write: Data modification
   - search: Query operations
   - consolidate: Data aggregation

## Rationale

### Protocol Choice
- JSON-RPC 2.0 provides structured method calls
- Resource URIs enable clear access patterns
- Operation types enforce access control

### Security Model
- Authentication per request
- Resource-level access control
- Audit logging of all operations

### Performance Features
- Connection pooling
- Request batching
- Caching support

## Implementation Details

1. Client Implementation:
```python
class MCPClient:
    def __init__(self, database: str):
        self.database = database
        self.auth_token = None
        
    async def connect(self):
        """Establish authenticated connection"""
        pass
        
    async def request(self, method: str, params: dict):
        """Make authenticated RPC request"""
        pass
```

2. Server Implementation:
```python
class MCPServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.resources = {}
        self.auth_manager = AuthManager()
        
    async def handle_request(self, request: dict):
        """Process authenticated RPC request"""
        pass
```

3. Resource Access:
```python
# Example resource access
await mcp_client.request("db.leads.read", {
    "query": {"status": "new"},
    "fields": ["id", "name", "score"]
})
```

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication:
   - Token-based auth
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. Data Protection:
   - TLS for transport security
   - Field-level access control
   - Audit logging

3. Access Patterns:
   - Resource isolation
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation

## Performance Impact

1. Optimization Strategies:
   - Connection pooling
   - Request batching
   - Response caching

2. Monitoring:
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - Error rates

## Consequences

### Positive
- Consistent access patterns
- Strong security model
- Performance optimization
- Clear audit trail

### Negative
- Protocol overhead
- Implementation complexity
- Learning curve

## Migration Strategy

1. Phase 1: Core Protocol
   - Basic auth
   - CRUD operations
   - Logging

2. Phase 2: Enhancement
   - Advanced security
   - Caching
   - Monitoring

3. Phase 3: Optimization
   - Performance tuning
   - Advanced features
   - Tools and utilities
