# Architecture Decision Record: Multi-Agent Architecture

## Title
ADR-001: Multi-Agent Marketing System Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system requires an AI-enhanced, scalable, and flexible architecture to support autonomous marketing operations through multiple specialized agents that can collaborate effectively while maintaining independent areas of responsibility. Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 enables advanced analysis and content generation capabilities.

## Decision
We will implement an AI-enhanced multi-agent system with the following core components:

1. AI-Enhanced Specialized Agents:
   - Lead Triage Agent with AI-driven lead analysis
   - Engagement Agent with GPT-4 powered content generation
   - Campaign Optimization Agent with AI-driven strategy recommendations

2. Communication & AI Infrastructure:
   - OpenAI integration for advanced capabilities
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure data access
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 for inter-agent communication
   - WebSocket and HTTP transport layers

3. AI-Enhanced Memory Architecture:
   - AI-augmented short-term memory for active contexts
   - Long-term memory with GPT-4 pattern analysis
   - Episodic memory with AI-driven success pattern recognition
   - Semantic memory using AI-enhanced knowledge graphs

## Rationale

### AI-Enhanced Agent Specialization
- Lead Triage Agent leverages GPT-4 for sophisticated lead analysis and scoring
- Engagement Agent uses AI for personalized content generation and communication
- Campaign Optimizer Agent employs AI for predictive analytics and strategy optimization

### Communication & AI Integration
- OpenAI API integration for advanced analysis and generation
- JSON-RPC 2.0 provides structured, language-agnostic communication
- WebSocket enables real-time updates
- HTTP supports RESTful operations with JWT authentication

### AI-Enhanced Memory System
- GPT-4 augmented memory processing for intelligent context handling
- AI-enhanced knowledge graphs capture complex relationships
- Advanced pattern recognition through machine learning
- Continuous learning from interactions and outcomes

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable and maintainable architecture
- Enhanced learning capabilities
- Real-time responsiveness

### Negative
- Increased system complexity
- Need for robust error handling
- Memory management overhead

## Implementation Notes

1. AI-Enhanced Agent Implementation:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: str, mcp_client: MCPClient, ai_service: OpenAIService):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.mcp_client = mcp_client
        self.ai_service = ai_service
        self.memory = MemorySystem(agent_id)

    async def analyze_context(self, context: Dict):
        """Analyze context using AI"""
        return await self.ai_service.analyze_context(context)
```

2. AI-Enhanced Inter-Agent Communication:
```python
async def handle_handoff(self, context: HandoffContext):
    """Handle agent handoff with AI-enhanced context preservation"""
    # Get AI insights
    ai_insights = await self.ai_service.analyze_handoff_context(context)
    
    # Preserve enhanced context
    enhanced_context = {**context, 'ai_insights': ai_insights}
    await self.memory.short_term.store(context.conversation_id, enhanced_context)
    
    # Notify target agent with enhanced context
    return await self.mcp_client.notify_handoff(enhanced_context)
```

## Security Considerations
- All agent communications are authenticated
- Data access is controlled through MCP
- Memory systems implement access controls

## Performance Implications
- Memory consolidation is scheduled during low-load periods
- Knowledge graph operations are optimized for quick retrieval
- Caching layers reduce database load
