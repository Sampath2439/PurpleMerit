# Multi-Agent Marketing System

A production-ready, scalable multi-agent marketing automation system implementing sophisticated lead triage, engagement, and campaign optimization capabilities with adaptive memory and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## 🚀 Overview

This system implements a comprehensive multi-agent architecture designed to autonomously manage marketing operations through three specialized agents:

- **Lead Triage Agent**: Categorizes and scores incoming leads using machine learning models
- **Engagement Agent**: Manages personalized multi-channel outreach and communication
- **Campaign Optimization Agent**: Monitors and optimizes campaign performance using data-driven strategies

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Agent Layer**: Three specialized agents with distinct responsibilities
- **Memory Architecture**: Multi-layered memory system (short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic)
- **Communication Layer**: MCP-based secure inter-agent communication
- **Data Layer**: Comprehensive marketing data management with ML pipeline
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints for external integration
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time system performance tracking
